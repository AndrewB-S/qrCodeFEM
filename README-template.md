### What I learned

I got a little tripped up on the correct way to order things so that it was responsive and made sense. Initially I applied way too many unneccessary styles and didn't correctly set up my media queries, but I trimmed that down, went mobile first thinking about what order made sense to style things, and I think this is a pretty clean way to go. Right now, it's really just a component that's just filling up all of its container, which in this case is the body.
